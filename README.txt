In case it doesn't work


due to how i don’t know how to do file paths in a way that would work on any computers, just follow these directions.


1. make sure that the image is in your user folder
   1. NOT IN THE FOLDER NAMED “Users”
      1. BUT THE FOLDER IN THAT ONE, IT SHOULD HAVE YOUR NAME
2. DO THE SAME FOR THE BACKGROUND BUT KNOW THAT THIS CAN BE CHANGED IN LINE 15
   1. IN FACT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHANGE IT
