The project Space Dodge (a Space Invader-like game) was started in mid-January and was completed on May 20th, 2024. Our goal was to create a video game in the style of a "shoot 'em up," even though it wasn't a typical school project. We faced many challenges that were eventually resolved, although it took many classes to address them. Ultimately, we learned a lot from the process and are proud of the final result, even though it isn't exactly what we envisioned.
